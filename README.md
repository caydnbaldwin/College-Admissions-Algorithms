# College Admissions Algorithms
A python program that recommends candidates for admission based upon a set of rules. For cause of improving justice and equality, exceptions are granted for outlier candidates based upon an additional set of rules.

## Instructions
Read in applicant dataset. Iterate through each student determining if they are a traditionally admitted student or an outlier (i.e., interest level, gpa, bad semester, or improving grades). Admit students that match intial or additional set of rules. 

## Application
This program offers an improved system for admitting students to universities that includes traditionally admitted students and outlier students.
